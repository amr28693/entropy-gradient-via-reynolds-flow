# Entropy Gradient via Reynolds Flow

## Overview

This repository implements a framework for modeling entropy production in dynamical systems using a Reynolds-like proxy \( \langle R \rangle \). The framework approximates the entropy gradient \( \frac{dS}{dt} \) by tracking changes in the global flow capacity of a network or system. The model includes both a linear and logarithmic version of the entropy gradient to capture nonlinear behaviors more effectively. The framework has applications in fields such as biological networks, infrastructure resilience, and complex systems.

## Conceptual Framework

### Reynolds-like Proxy

The Reynolds-like proxy \( \langle R \rangle \) is calculated as the average inverse edge weight in a graph-based network:

\[
\langle R \rangle_t = \frac{1}{|E|} \sum_{(i,j) \in E} \frac{1}{w_{ij}}
\]

Where \( w_{ij} \) represents the resistance between nodes \( i \) and \( j \), and \( |E| \) is the total number of edges.

### Entropy Gradient

The entropy gradient can be approximated by the negative time derivative of the Reynolds-like proxy, capturing how changes in flow correlate with entropy production:

Linear Form:

\[
\frac{dS}{dt} \approx - \left( \langle R \rangle_t - \langle R \rangle_{t-1} \right)
\]

Logarithmic Form:

\[
\frac{dS}{dt} \approx - \left( \log(\langle R \rangle_t) - \log(\langle R \rangle_{t-1}) \right)
\]

The logarithmic version is particularly useful for capturing nonlinear behaviors in complex systems.

Running the Simulation
After setting up the environment, you can run the simulation by opening the Jupyter notebook:

Execute the cells in entropy-gradient-via-reynolds-flow.ipynb to run the simulation. The notebook provides an interactive interface for modifying parameters like collapse threshold, viscosity, and network structure.

Adjustable Parameters
Collapse Threshold: Controls when the system is considered to have "collapsed."

Viscosity: Modifies the resistance in the system and impacts the rate of flow decay.

Edge Resistance: The weight of each edge in the network determines the flow capacity.

## Limitations and Future Work

While this framework is broadly applicable, it is constructed using a discrete, graph-based model rather than continuous field equations. The entropy gradient presented here functions as a coarse-grained proxy, approximating thermodynamic behavior without requiring microscopic statistical ensembles. Likewise, the Reynolds-like observable \( \langle R \rangle \) captures global flow potential but does not resolve localized nonlinearities, feedback loops, or turbulence.

These approximations reflect the minimality of the model, not a theoretical constraint. The framework is designed to be lightweight, interpretable, and generalizable—capable of identifying collapse precursors even in systems with limited observability. Future work may extend this model to continuous fields, agent-based hybrids, or PDE-governed dynamics to test the robustness of this entropy-flow coupling across different complexity classes.
